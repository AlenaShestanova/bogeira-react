    "description": "Imagery and mystery of the Assyrian art have been impressing me for a long stretch of time. Its cuneiform characters are ornamental and precise. This system of signs is the starting point of creating of this jewelry piece. The assyriologist and reader of Higher School of Economics Ilya Archipov helped me to understand the meaning of some symbols. He suggested several different options to choose from, and I went for the clearest and the simplest one. The shape of the paper knife is stylized cuneiform GÍR, which is a figure of a knife and is translated likewise. In my opinion nowadays a paper knife is a symbol of opening a letter, a text and knowledge hidden from the others’ eyes.",

This goes against my awareness of this beautiful creature. Indeed, this is the most amazing and one of the smartest marine animals. I prefer to call it in the manner of the Latin language - sepia.",

Frequently they depictured other planets’ imaginary nature, which stood in stark contrast to ours, but inherently it was of similar structure. The brass decorative plate with split-level etching is an artistic vision of alien flora.",
