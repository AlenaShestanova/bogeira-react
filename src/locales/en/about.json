    "why_bogeira": "My name is Irina Bogolyubova and I am a jewelry artist. My creative alias is Bogeira.",
    "bogeira_info": "To my mind, a jewelry art piece is a sculptural form fitted into environment of a human body. It is a story about sense, tactility and feeling. I prefer making handiwork, I love creating non-symmetric pieces. It is my understanding that a jewelry should be extremely comfortable and feel-good despite of the size. Now I work mostly in stainless steel and stoving enamel.",
