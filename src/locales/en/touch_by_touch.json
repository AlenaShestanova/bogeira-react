    "description": "«Touch by touch» is sensuality in metal frame. It is my belief that the most intimate branch of art is jewelry. It exists in the relationship with human body: an orfevrerie adjoints body curves, it is in close contact with the skin. Touch is one of the most important tools to perceive the world and ourselves. Working on the collection, I was eager to create a tactile dialogue. The basic principle of shaping pieces is modeling by touching. Body is an environment for the jewelry pieces and the key moment is to feel the jewels.",
